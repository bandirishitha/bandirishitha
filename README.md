  ### Girl Scout Law

I  â™¥  open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the girlscout rule.  I contribute projects I come across which can be asked while taking new job interviews along with some personal ones. I am always there to help incase you have any questions related to stuff I post ðŸ’¬.
